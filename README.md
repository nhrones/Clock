# Dot Clock

The code in the 'src' folder is **_heavily commented_**! It was built as a learning exercise for a grandson who was studing CS at UGA.   

## No Jank!
The interesting bits of this exercise was the use of a resource-pool to improve performance and reduce V8-GC.    
`See: /src/dotPool.ts`

## Unique partical effect
Below the clock are four slider controls. Try moving each slider to change the animation. The **_partical-trails_** slider is most interesting.     

## Have fun!
